This is a simple, clean Accessible + Responsive Navbar built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

The goal of this project is to turn a static design into accessible, modern code â€” and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from.

_This project is part of a free, open-source series focused on helping newer developers practice HTML, CSS + JavaScript with real-world examples._
